- **[adr/](adr/)** — 42 Architecture Decision Records (the *why* behind every design choice).

## One-paragraph mental model

`geekstackflow` puts a `.tcgstackflow/` folder in your project. That folder is the **shared brain** your AI tools read from: an AI-maintained **wiki** (project memory), a strict two-file **task** system, six **agent** roles — five in a clear lifecycle (`planner → coder → reviewer → tester → ingester`) plus an on-demand **refactorer** — **governance** with risk levels, and per-tool **adapters** (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, Copilot). You drive work with `/tcgflow-*` **commands** (or natural language in any tool), and run it all from a local **Cockpit Orchestrator** (`geekstackflow ui`) that launches the next agent directly or hands you a copy-paste prompt. Everything is plain files — no database; the files are the source of truth.
